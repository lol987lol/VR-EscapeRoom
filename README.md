# VR-EscapeRoom - Just another way to Narnia

This is a self-made VR escape room. It was designed for the HTC-Vive, but can also be used without any problems with other VR headset manufacturers as long as they offer Open VR.



## Getting Started

So far you can only run the first Version of the game [here](https://github.com/lol987lol/VR-EscapeRoom/releases) or build the current state of the development via the Unity scene. The game should be fully functional at the beginning of august as .exe file for all Open-VR devices. Until then ... be patient :D 



### Prerequisites

To run the current state of the game you will need:

* A Open-VR Headset (preferably an HTC-VIVE)
* [Unity](https://unity3d.com/de/get-unity/download) installed on your computer
* The full downloaded unity project
* The .unity Scene out of the "Asset" folder (V0.4)
